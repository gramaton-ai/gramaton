# Changelog

All notable changes to Gramaton are documented in this file.

Format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).
Versioning follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- `gramaton tempdir` command -- prints the OS-appropriate temp directory
  path so agents can discover where to write input files
- `--file`/`-f` flag on `capture`, `classify`, `update` -- reads JSON
  from a file instead of stdin, avoids shell heredoc escaping issues
  that trigger safety heuristics in agent harnesses
- Auto-cleanup of temp files after successful read, stale file sweep
  (1 hour) on each write command invocation
- v0.2 server design document covering on-demand daemon model, HTTP
  REST API, CLI thin client, autonomous curation, MCP integration,
  and usage topologies. All architecture decisions resolved. Security
  review completed with 12 additional findings documented.

### Security

- Restrict `--file` to gramaton temp directory only, reject arbitrary paths
- Resolve symlinks before path validation to prevent symlink-based escapes
- Read via file descriptor to avoid TOCTOU between validation and read
- Verify input is a regular file (not device, pipe, or symlink)
- Strip absolute paths from error messages to prevent info disclosure
- Sweep removes symlinks unconditionally from temp directory

## [0.1.0] - 2026-04-04

First working release. CLI-driven knowledge store for AI agents with
property graph storage, vector search, and versioned persistence.

### Added

- **Graph engine** -- property graph with 8 typed properties (String,
  Float64, Int64, Bool, Timestamp, Vector, StringList, Bytes), ULID node
  and edge IDs, safe property accessors
- **Content-addressed storage** -- SHA-256 hashing, atomic writes via
  temp+rename, hex-validated paths, 0o700 directory permissions
- **Prolly trees** -- probabilistic B-trees with FNV-1a rolling hash for
  content-defined chunk boundaries, configurable chunk size and split
  probability, O(changes) commit diffs with subtree skipping
- **Versioned commits** -- v0 (flat hash lists) and v1 (prolly tree roots)
  format, backward-compatible loading, per-record history via
  NodeHashInCommit (O(log N))
- **Property index** -- exact match (serialized value map), range queries
  (sorted slice + binary search), substring search (case-insensitive
  Contains)
- **Vector index** -- flat index with cosine similarity, candidate set
  filtering, keyed by node ID
- **Search** -- 6-factor scoring model (similarity, recency, freshness,
  frequency, activation, confidence), metadata filtering (temporality,
  knowledge type, epistemic status, confidence range, date range),
  configurable result count
- **Spreading activation** -- access recording increments access_count and
  updates last_accessed, one-hop neighbor boosting with configurable base
  amount and attenuation factor
- **Document chunking** -- configurable threshold, chunk size, and overlap,
  word-boundary-aware splitting, parent-child edge linking
- **Dedup detection** -- vector similarity threshold check before capture
- **Embedding** -- Ollama provider with HTTP client (60s timeout),
  auto-start via lifecycle management, auto-model-pull, guided init with
  platform-specific install instructions
- **Branching** -- create, list, checkout, merge (fast-forward), discard,
  branch name sanitization
- **CLI commands** -- capture, search, inspect, explore, update, delete,
  classify, pending, ingest, reembed, branch, diff, log, revert, status,
  init
- **Diff** -- commit-level diff with prolly tree subtree skipping, --since
  and --topic flags, short hash resolution
- **Per-record log** -- track property changes across commits for a
  specific record, showing from/to diffs
- **Agent integration** -- Claude Code CLAUDE.md template, capture and
  curation subagent prompts, Kiro skill definitions, custom agent
  integration guide
- **Piggyback curation** -- curation status (pending_count, overdue)
  appended to search/inspect/explore responses, triggers agent-driven
  classification of pending records
- **Security hardening** -- input validation with LimitReader, BOM
  stripping, UTF-8 validation, null byte rejection, allocation guards
  (10M element max), symlink protection on ingest, 0o600 file permissions
- **Configuration** -- YAML config with all design doc defaults, prolly
  tree tuning parameters, activation settings, storage paths
